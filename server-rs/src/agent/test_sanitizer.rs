//! @docs ARCHITECTURE:Agent
//!
//! ### AI Assist Note
//! **Sanitizer Verification (Bypass Detection Tests)**: Orchestrates
//! the verification of the prompt injection and data leakage
//! detection for the Tadpole OS engine. Features **Instruction
//! Override Detection**: validates that the `Sanitizer` correctly
//! identifies and alerts on common jailbreak patterns
//! ("Ignore all", "SYSTEM OVERRIDE"). Implements **Token Leakage
//! Prevention**: ensures that sensitive environment variables or
//! simulated secrets are caught before mission execution. AI
//! agents should run these tests after updating the `Sanitizer`
//! regex patterns to ensure the security boundary remains effective
//! against evolving injection tactics (SEC-06).
//!
//! ### 🔍 Debugging & Observability
//! - **Failure Path**: False positives on harmless technical text
//!   (e.g., "override" in a code comment), regex performance
//!   degradation on very large inputs, or bypass mutations using
//!   uncommon character encodings.
//! - **Trace Scope**: `server-rs::agent::test_sanitizer`
