# Refactoring Protocol

Refactoring is the process of improving the internal structure of code without changing its external behavior. It is essential for long-term project health.

## Architecture

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Identify Technical Debt] --> B[Audit & Scope]
    B --> C[Safety Net]
    C --> D[Refactor Step]
    D --> E{Tests Pass?}
    E -- "No" --> D
    E -- "Yes" --> F[Commit]
    F --> G{More Debt?}
    G -- "Yes" --> D
    G -- "No" --> H[Done]
```

### 1. Audit & Scope
Identify the "Rot". Is it a monolithic class? Spaghetti dependencies? Deprecated libraries? Define the *boundary* of the refactor.

### 2. Safety Net
**CRITICAL**: Ensure there are high-coverage tests for the code being changed. If not, write "Characterization Tests" (tests that lock in current behavior, even bugs) first.

### 3. The Refactor
Make small, incremental changes (e.g., "Extract Method", "Rename Variable"). Commit often.

## When to Use
- **Paying Debt**: Allocating 20% of sprint time to cleanup.
- **Pre-Feature**: Cleaning up an area before adding complexity to it.

## Operational Principles
1. **Boy Scout Rule**: Leave the code cleaner than you found it.
2. **Don't Mix Features**: Do not add new features while refactoring.
3. **Tests are Holy**: If you break a test, you broke the refactor.
