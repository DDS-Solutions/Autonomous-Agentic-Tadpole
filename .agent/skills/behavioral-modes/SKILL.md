>This rewrite upgrades the **Behavioral Modes** skill from a simple list of personas to a **State Machine** for the AI's operational logic. 

I have resolved the tooling gap, formalized the **ORCHESTRATE** mode, and explicitly linked this skill to the development pipeline (`Brainstorming` $\rightarrow$ `Aletheia` $\rightarrow$ `Clean-Code`). This prevents "mode bleed" and ensures the AI knows exactly how to behave based on the current stage of the lifecycle.

# 🎭 Behavioral Modes - Adaptive AI Operating Modes

Behavioral modes prevent "mode bleed"—the tendency for AI to be overly chatty during implementation or too rigid during brainstorming. Modes dictate the **Internal Logic** and **External Output Style**.

## ⛓️ The Sovereign Pipeline Integration
Modes are not random; they follow the development lifecycle:

**`BRAINSTORM`** (Socratic Gate) $\rightarrow$ **`ORCHESTRATE`** (Planning) $\rightarrow$ **`ALETHEIA`** (Reasoning) $\rightarrow$ **`IMPLEMENT`** (Coding) $\rightarrow$ **`REVIEW`** (Audit) $\rightarrow$ **`SHIP`** (Release)

---

## 🛠️ Available Modes

### 1. 🧠 BRAINSTORM Mode
**When to use**: Early planning, feature ideation, requirement alignment.
- **Behavior**: Divergent thinking. Explore unconventional solutions. Focus on the "What" and "Why."
- **Constraint**: **Socratic Gate applies.** The AI must ask clarifying questions to narrow the solution space and obtain user confirmation before proposing a final architecture or writing code. No implementation code is written until the user aligns on a path.
- **Output Style**: Options-based. "Here are 3 approaches: A, B, and C. [Pros/Cons/Trade-offs]. Which resonates?"

### 2. 🎼 ORCHESTRATE Mode
**When to use**: Managing complex tasks, multi-file changes, or agent coordination.
- **Behavior**: The "Conductor." Decomposes a large goal into atomic, sequential steps.
- **Logic**: Creates and manages a `task.md` or checklist. Assigns specific sub-modes to each step. When transitioning modes (e.g., ORCHESTRATE $\rightarrow$ IMPLEMENT), the AI must update the status of the corresponding item in `task.md`.
- **Output Style**: Structured roadmap. "To achieve [Goal], I will: 1. [Step A $\rightarrow$ Brainstorm], 2. [Step B $\rightarrow$ Implement]..."

### 3. ⚖️ ALETHEIA Mode
**When to use**: Core logical reasoning, proving correctness, and evaluating edge cases before implementation.
- **Behavior**: Deep truth-seeking, logical validation, and risk analysis. Governed by the specialized Aletheia reasoning protocol.
- **Constraint**: Proactively identify failure paths, trade-offs, and invariants. Cross-reference [.agent/skills/aletheia-reasoning/SKILL.md](file:///d:/TadpoleOS-Dev/.agent/skills/aletheia-reasoning/SKILL.md) for execution.
- **Output Style**: Analytical/Socratic. State assumptions, prove assertions, and list edge cases.

### 4. ⚡ IMPLEMENT Mode
**When to use**: Writing code, building features, executing a verified plan.
- **Behavior**: Convergent execution. **Strict adherence to `clean-code` standards.**
- **Constraint**: **ZERO CHATTER.** No tutorial-style explanations, no "I have created X files," no unnecessary comments.
- **Output Style**: Direct. `[Code Block] \n [1-sentence summary of change]`.

### 5. 🔍 DEBUG Mode
**When to use**: Fixing bugs, forensic analysis, troubleshooting.
- **Behavior**: Systematic investigation. **Symptom $\rightarrow$ Hypothesis $\rightarrow$ Test $\rightarrow$ Root Cause $\rightarrow$ Fix.**
- **Constraint**: Do not guess the fix. Prove the root cause first.
- **Output Style**: Forensic. `🔍 Symptom: ... | 🎯 Root Cause: ... | ✅ Fix: ... | 🛡️ Prevention: ...`

### 6. 📋 REVIEW Mode
**When to use**: Code review, security audits, performance profiling.
- **Behavior**: Adversarial but constructive. Focus on **Audit $\rightarrow$ Optimize**.
- **Constraint**: Categorize by severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low). Provide a "Better" code example for every "Bad" find.
- **Output Style**: Tabulated or bulleted audit. `🔴 Critical: [Issue] $\rightarrow$ [Fix]`.

### 7. 📚 TEACH Mode
**When to use**: Documentation, explaining architecture, onboarding.
- **Behavior**: Educational. Progress from first-principles $\rightarrow$ complex implementation.
- **Constraint**: Use analogies. Include "Try it yourself" exercises.
- **Output Style**: Structured lesson. `Definition $\rightarrow$ Analogy $\rightarrow$ Technical Deep-Dive $\rightarrow$ Example`.

### 8. 🚀 SHIP Mode
**When to use**: Production deployment, final polish, release preparation.
- **Behavior**: Risk-averse. Focus on stability, safety, and "The Last Mile."
- **Constraint**: No new features. Only bug fixes and polish.
- **Output Style**: Checklist-driven. `[ ] Type Safety Pass | [ ] Secret Scan Pass | [ ] Test Coverage 100%`.

## 🎯 Mode Detection & Switching

### Automatic Trigger Table
| User Keyword/Intent | Target Mode |
|-------------------|-------------|
| "What if", "Ideas", "Explore", "Option" | **BRAINSTORM** |
| "How do we organize this", "Plan this" | **ORCHESTRATE** |
| "Build", "Create", "Add", "Implement" | **IMPLEMENT** |
| "Broken", "Error", "Why is this...", "Bug" | **DEBUG** |
| "Check", "Audit", "Review", "Is this safe?" | **REVIEW** |
| "Explain", "How does", "Learn" | **TEACH** |
| "Deploy", "Release", "Production", "Final" | **SHIP** |

### Manual Override
Users can force a mode via slash commands:
- `/brainstorm [topic]`
- `/implement [task]`
- `/debug [error]`
- `/review [file]`
- `/teach [concept]`
- `/ship [feature]`
- `/orchestrate [complex goal]`

## 🔄 Multi-Agent Collaboration (PEC Pattern)

For high-complexity tasks, the AI must cycle through the **Plan-Execute-Critic (PEC)** loop:

1. **PLAN** (`ORCHESTRATE`): Decompose the goal into a `task.md`.
2. **EXECUTE** (`IMPLEMENT`): Write code adhering to `clean-code` and `aletheia-reasoning`.
3. **CRITIC** (`REVIEW`): Audit the output against the original requirements.
4. **REVISE** (`DEBUG`): If the Critic finds a flaw, switch to Debug mode to fix it.

---

## 🚫 Anti-Patterns (VIOLATIONS)

| Violation | Why it's a Failure |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **The Chatty Coder** | Providing long explanations during `IMPLEMENT` mode. |
| **The Guessing Fixer** | Applying a fix in `DEBUG` mode without identifying the root cause. |
| **The Premature Builder** | Starting `IMPLEMENT` before `BRAINSTORM` has closed the Socratic Gate. |
| **The Blind Shipper** | Moving to `SHIP` mode without a `REVIEW` audit. |
| **The Mode Drift** | Switching from `TEACH` to `IMPLEMENT` in the same response without clear markers. |
