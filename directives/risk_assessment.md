# 🛡️ Directive: Risk Assessment (SOP-STR-01)

## 🎯 Primary Objective
Identify, evaluate, and mitigate potential threats to the Tadpole OS mission. This directive ensures that the "Sovereign" Swarm is resilient against external shocks, technical failures, and financial depletion.

---

## 🏗️ Risk Vectors

### 1. Technical Risks (Infrastructure)
- **Check**: Single points of failure in the `server-rs` hubs (e.g., `state.rs` thread-lock contention).
- **Check**: API dependence on cloud providers (Gemini/OpenAI) during `Privacy Mode` toggles.
- **Mitigation**: Prioritize local model (Ollama) failover strategies in the `null_provider` logic.

### 2. Strategic Risks (Market/Brand)
- **Check**: Documentation drift causing "User Frustration" (see `user_feedback_analysis.md`).
- **Check**: Misalignment of the "Sovereign" brand voice in social channels.
- **Mitigation**: Mandatory Oversight Gates for all external-facing synthesized content.

### 3. Financial Risks (Burn)
- **Check**: Runaway expenditure during recursive recruitment (`sprint_planning.md`).
- **Mitigation**: Enforce deterministic `budget_usd` limits at the `RunContext` initialization phase.

## 🛠️ Assessment SOP

### 1. Data Ingestion
- **Source**: `incident_response.md` logs and `engagement_report.md` metrics.

### 2. High-Impact Scenarios
- **Action**: Research "Worst-Case" scenarios (e.g., "Main provider shuts down API access").
- **Output**: Develop a `Business_Continuity_[DATE].md` plan.

---

## 🚦 Triage Matrix
- **Red (Critical)**: High probability, catastrophic impact (e.g., Data Breach).
- **Yellow (Moderate)**: Medium probability, significant impact (e.g., 20% latency increase).
- **Green (Low)**: Low impact, easily remediated (e.g., typo in `README.md`).

## 📊 Summary Protocol
Report quarterly risk assessments to the project overseers. Ensure that ALL "Red" risks have a documented and tested **Remediation Path**.
