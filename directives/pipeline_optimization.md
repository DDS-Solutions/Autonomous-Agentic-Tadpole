# ⚡ Directive: Pipeline Optimization (SOP-DEV-08)

## 🎯 Primary Objective
Deliver maximum velocity for the "Path to Production." This directive governs the technical optimization of build, test, and deployment chains.

---

## 🏎️ Optimization Vectors

### 1. Build Latency Reduction
- **Rust**: Enable `incremental` compilation and use `sccache` for cross-build caching.
- **Frontend**: Optimize Vite chunk splitting and use the `esbuild` transformer for development.

### 2. Efficient Testing
- **Action**: Implement "Test Sharding" to run independent suites in parallel.
- **Logic**: Use `cargo-nextest` for the backend to achieve significant speedups over standard `cargo test`.

### 3. Dependency Cache
- **Goal**: Zero re-installation of untouched dependencies.
- **Check**: Verify CI cache-key integrity for `Cargo.lock` and `package-lock.json`.

## 🛠️ Operational SOP

### 1. Bottleneck Identification
- **Tool**: Time-trace the final CI/CD output.
- **Metric**: Identify the "Longest Pole" (the step that takes the most time).

### 2. Parallelization Audit
- **Check**: Identify steps that can be run concurrently (e.g., Linting and Security Scanning).

## 📊 Performance Tracking
Monitor the "Commit-to-Feedback" duration. High efficiency is achieved when the developer receives build/test results within 180 seconds of code-push.
