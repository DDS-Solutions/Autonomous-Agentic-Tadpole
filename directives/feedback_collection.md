# 🗣️ Directive: Feedback Collection (SOP-PRO-02)

## 🎯 Primary Objective
Govern the acquisition of high-signal user feedback from the Tadpole OS community. This directive ensures that raw input is transformed into actionable intelligence for the engineering team.

---

## 🏗️ Collection Channels

### 1. In-App Telemetry
- **Action**: Monitor the `user_feedback_analysis.md` for patterns extracted from the Sovereign Dashboard's interactive feedback modules.

### 2. External Pulse
- **Focus**: GitHub Discussions, Discord Support threads, and Social Media mentions.
- **Action**: Use the `social_strategy.md` engagement logic to solicit specific feedback on new features.

---

## 🛠️ Processing SOP

### 1. Triage Gate
- **Critical**: Security faults or "Engine Stall" reports (High 429 frequency).
- **Growth**: New provider requests or UI layout improvements.
- **Technical**: Documentation gaps or unclear error messages.

### 2. The "Loop Closure"
- **Requirement**: Every critical feedback item must be linked to a specific GitHub Issue or a `feature_roadmap.md` entry.
- **Action**: Provide a direct, technical response to the user acknowledging the receipt and the planned remediation.
