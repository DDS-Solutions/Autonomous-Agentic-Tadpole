# ⛓️ Directive: Pipeline Management (SOP-DEV-07)

## 🎯 Primary Objective
Govern and optimize the automated CI/CD infrastructure. This directive ensures that the "Path to Production" is fast, reliable, and provides absolute diagnostic clarity.

---

## 🏗️ Maintenance Lifecycle

### 1. Error Analysis
- **Source**: `logs/pipeline_errors.log`.
- **Action**: Identify "Flaky Tests" or "Environment Drift" that causes false negatives in the `ci_cd_pipeline.md` runs.
- **Remediation**: Isolate non-deterministic tests using Vitest retries or Rust `#[tokio::test]` timeout adjustments.

### 2. Environment Parity
- **Check**: Ensure that the staging environment matches the production `workspaces/` structure and `.env` schema exactly.
- **Tool**: `python execution/verify_all.py .`

### 3. Pipeline Throughput
- **Goal**: Commit-to-Staging time < 5 minutes.
- **Action**: Audit build steps. Use `cargo-nextest` or cached `node_modules` to accelerate the cycle.

---

## 🛠️ Optimization SOP

### 1. Log Pruning
- **Action**: Regularly archive old build artifacts to prevent disk bloat.
- **Standard**: Maintain the last 30 days of "Sovereign" branch build logs for forensic auditing.

### 2. Secret Hygiene
- **Check**: Verify that the `scanner.rs` utility is correctly redaction-checking all pipeline outputs.

## 📊 Performance Reporting
Generate a monthly `PIPELINE_HEALTH_[MONTH].md` report. Track the "Build Success Velocity" — the ratio of successful builds to total commits.
