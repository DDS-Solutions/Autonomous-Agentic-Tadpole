# 🗺️ Directive: Feature Roadmap (SOP-PRO-01)

## 🎯 Primary Objective
Govern the long-term technological evolution of the Tadpole OS cluster. This directive ensures that the roadmap is a living document, balanced between "Sovereign Innovation" and "Operational Stability."

---

## 🏗️ Roadmap Pillars

### 1. Zero-Friction Orchestration
- **Focus**: Improving swarm recruitment velocity and multi-agent synergy.
- **Goal**: Reduce "Inter-Agent Latency" by 50% through shared memory optimizations.

### 2. High-Fidelity Observability
- **Focus**: Real-time telemetry and "God View" visualization.
- **Goal**: Implement 100% trace coverage for recursive sub-node missions.

### 3. Local-First Sovereignty
- **Focus**: Expanding local model support (Ollama/ONNX/LM Studio/vLLM) to reduce cloud dependency.
- **Goal**: Achieving 100% functional parity between cloud and local providers for core utility skills.
- **Active Spec**: `IMR-01` — Intelligent Model Registry & Capability Sync. Includes full local model capability matrix covering Llama 3, Phi-3/4, Mistral, Qwen, Gemma, DeepSeek, and embedding models. [→ Spec](features/intelligent-model-registry.md)

## 🛠️ Prioritization Methodology
- **Sources**: `user_feedback_analysis.md`, `market_trend_analysis.md`, and `RETROSPECTIVE_[ID].md`.
- **Logic**: Items are scored based on **Impact vs. Complexity**. P0 items (Security/Stability) always jump the queue.

## 📁 Feature Specification Pattern
Each roadmap item requiring significant architecture gets a dedicated Feature Spec in `directives/features/`. 
Specs must include: Problem Statement, Architecture, Files Affected, Implementation Plan (sprints), and Acceptance Criteria.
The `ROADMAP.md` Feature Specs table is the authoritative index of all active specs.

---

## 📊 Roadmap Management
Update `docs/CODEBASE_MAP.md` to reflect upcoming architectural changes. All major roadmap items require a dedicated `system_architecture_review.md` before development begins.

## 🚦 Approval
Strategic roadmap pivots must be presented in the monthly `ops_review.md` and authorized by a human overseer.
