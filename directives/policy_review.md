# 📜 Directive: Policy Review (SOP-STR-04)

## 🎯 Primary Objective
Govern the regular audit and evolution of the Tadpole OS internal policies. This directive ensures that the "Sovereign" governance framework remains aligned with the latest security standards and legal requirements.

---

## 🏗️ Review Vectors

### 1. Security & Privacy Policies
- **Check**: Audit `directives/security_audit.md` and `docs/SECURITY.md`.
- **Constraint**: Ensure policies correctly reflect current sandbox escape protections and `Privacy Mode` implementations.

### 2. Operational Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
- **Check**: Do the active directives correctly reflect the current state of tools in `execution/`?
- **Action**: Identify and flag any "Instructional Drift" where the policy suggests a tool that has been refactored or deprecated.

### 3. Ethical Alignment
- **Focus**: Review the "Sovereign Oath" (if applicable) and ensure agent missions adhere to the project's core principles (e.g., "Privacy-First," "Non-Aggression").

## 🛠️ Review SOP

### 1. The Audit Loop
- **Action**: Use a specialized specialist agent to compare `directives/*.md` against all recently updated source files and `walkthrough.md` reports.

### 2. Revision Protocol
- **Action**: Drafting the `POLICY_REVISION_[DATE].md`. 
- **Approval**: Major policy shifts require 100% consensus from the Oversight Board.

## 🚦 Compliance Check
Run `python execution/verify_all.py .` (Compliance category) to ensure that code-level gates (e.g., `Oversight Gate`, `Burn Rate Alert`) match the written policy.
